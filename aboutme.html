        I am a graduate student at Portland State University.Pursuing a degree
        in Computer Science. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and a
        Master's degree in Computer Application. Interpreting data generally
        excites me. After my graduation, I would like to see myself do something
        in the field of Data Science. I would like the data to be ethically
        obtained / harvested from people. And would like to contribute towards
        this cause in some way.Currently, I do not have any work experience. Am
        hoping to gather some during the course of my degree.
